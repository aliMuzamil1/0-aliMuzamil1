- 👋 Hi, I’m Muzamil
- 👀 I’m interested in devops tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Jenkins.
- I have already basic level hands on experience of Linux/bash, Python, Terraform, Github and Github actions for CI/CD pipelines. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small project to learn DEVOPS technologies.
